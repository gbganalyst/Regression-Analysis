# Regression Model Analysis
Statistics students need to understand how to interpret regression model. With this, I solved questions on regression model accordingly using #Rstats. Kudos to my lecturers at the University of Ilorin in the persons of Dr M.K Garba and Prof. W.B Yahya. I must also thank Hadley Wickham, the Chief Data Scientist at Rstudio for his book **R for data science** that taught me #Rstats
